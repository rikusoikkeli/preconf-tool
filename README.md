# preconf-tool

WHAT DOES THE CODE DO:

This project actually comprises three work-related Python projects which I eventually packed into one graphical user interface.

First, I wanted to automate away the tedious process of converting configuration data of our network devices into a format read 
by the TTL scripting language. So when our associates send us new configurations, the process of implementing them into our 
scripts becomes super fast.

Second, my supervisor voiced the need for him to know, in advance, how much work (in man-hours) our unit would have in a given day. 
So I created a program which fetched data from few of our systems and used it to calculate the answer.

Third, there was a recurring problem of certain orders getting bogged in our systems without anyone knowing. Which would then be 
realised as hefty penalties for our unit. So, again, I created a tool which fetched the relevant data from our systems and gave a 
warning if something like it was about to happen.
